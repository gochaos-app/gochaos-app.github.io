go-chaos is a chaos engineering tool, that lets you inject chaos in your cloud infrastructure with declarative code while at the same time minimizing the blast radius. 

Use Cases:
* Better understanding of your own infrastructure. 
* go-chaos can help you to monitor what matters.
* Increases reliability and resiliancy. 
* Better team collaboration when incidents do happen. 

Modern software comes with complexity that usually a single team is unable to manage. Tech companies spent time and money on better ways to either remove or trying to minimize complexity, we at go-chaos, understand that complexity is an inherit part of software development, so we embrace it and navigate around it with chaos experiments.
