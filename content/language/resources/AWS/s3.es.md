#### Storage S3

```HCL
job "aws" "s3" {
    region = "us-east-1"
    config "chaos" {
        tag = "PREFIX:second"
        chaos = "terminate"
        count = 2
    }
}
```

S3 uses PREFIX and SUFFIX to find specific buckets, if bucket name is "db-files-inventory-qa" you can find this bucket with "PREFIX:db" or "inventory-qa" 

chaos config:
* *terminate*: Finds specified S3 buckets, deletes the content and terminate the buckets.
* *delete_content*: Will delete *N* number ( with count parameter) of objects in specified buckets.
